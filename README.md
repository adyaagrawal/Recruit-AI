An android app that makes online recruitements easy and effective. 
Consists of 2 phases: 
1. RESUME ANALYSIS PHASE:- For resume analysis, the applicant will submit his resume in the upload section of our app; the target company will upload their job description in pdf format in their respective upload section. After receiving both the documents they will be processed with NLP algos and compared and a match percentage will be displayed.

2. ONLINE INTERVIEW PHASE:- During the Interview, our app will analyze two processes- Firstly, analyze the Confidence level/Facial Expression of the candidate in answering each of the questions; Secondly, divide the recorded videos into small chunks and convert all the answers from speech to text and get the whole interview in the text format to later analyze the answers.
